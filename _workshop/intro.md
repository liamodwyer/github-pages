When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things.
* our name and email address
* what our preferred text editor is
* and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project)

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git` `verb` `options`, where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional  information which may be needed for the verb.

Open __Git Bash__ from wherever you installed it. There is a GUI for Git and you may have installed it but for this lesson we will be working mostly in the command line.

#### Account setup:
First we‚Äôll configure your __name__ and __email address__.
```
git config --global user.name "<username>"
git config --global user.email "<email address>"
```

This user name and email account will be associated with your subsequent Git activity. Any changes pushed to GitHub or another Git host server after this lesson will include this information. In this lesson, we will be interacting with GitHub and so __*the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account*__.

üìå __Keeping your email private__: If you are concerned about privacy, you can read [here](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/) how to keep your email address private.

#### Branch naming:
All file changes are associated with a ‚Äúbranch.‚Äù For now, it‚Äôs enough to know that branches exist. By default, Git creates a branch called `master` when you create a new repository with `git init` (as explained in the next Episode).

In 2020, most Git code hosting services transitioned to using `main` as the default branch. Any new repository in GitHub and GitLab defaults to `main`. However, Git has not yet made the same change. To change the default on Git to match, enter the following command:

```
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Note that if this value is unset in your local Git configuration, the init.defaultBranch value defaults to master. You can check your settings at any time:

```
$ git config --list
```

üìå __Line endings__: As with other keys, when you hit Return on your keyboard, your computer encodes this input as a character. Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line. (You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.) Because Git uses these characters to compare files, it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines. Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue in the [Pro Git book](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf).

You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings using the core.autocrlf command to git config. The following settings are recommended:

* On macOS and Linux:
   ```
   $ git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```
* And on Windows:
   ```
   $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
   ```

üìå __Text editors__: We'll be working within our Git Bash window for most of this lesson but for some operations Git needs to open an associated text editor. _Vim_ is the default on most installs.

If you haven‚Äôt used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving your changes, press `Esc` then type `:q!` and hit `Return`. If you want to save your changes and quit, press `Esc` then type `:wq` and hit `Return`.

Or we can also set our favorite text editor if you didn't select one on your Git install:

| __Editor__                         | __Configuration command__                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Atom                               | $ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"                                                                          |
| Nano (Mac)                         | $ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"                                                                              |
| Notepad (Win)	                     | $ git config --global core.editor "notepad"                                                                              |
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | $ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin" |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | $ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"                                |


I use atom so I will switch to that:
```
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

üìå __Shell Commands__: As well as Git commands we‚Äôll be using some shell commands in this lesson:
* `pwd` (print working directory) is useful to orient yourself
* `cd` (change directory) on its own will get you to your home directory
* `mkdir` (make directory)

We have a cheat sheet pdf with more shell and git commands [here](./assets/documents/GitCheatSheet.pdf)

### Creating a repository

A Git _repository_ is a data structure used to track changes to a set of project files over time.

Repositories are stored within the same directory as these project files, in a hidden directory called `.git`. We can create a new git repository either remotely via our GitHub account, or locally via the command line. Let‚Äôs use the command line.

* First, we will create a new directory for our project and enter that directory.
* Go to your desktop and make a folder called _gitlesson_. (It doesn‚Äôt really matter where, as long as you know, but if you are not familiar with shell commands then desktop is easiest).
* Then move into that folder you have created.
```
$ cd ~/desktop
$ mkdir gitlesson
$ cd gitlesson
```
We can check if there is anything in our folder using `ls` which lists the contents of the directory you‚Äôre in
```
$ ls
```

We have an empty folder.  Now create an empty Git repository using `git init` (short for _initialise_)
```
$ git init
  Initialized empty Git repository in <your file path>/gitlesson/.git/
```

üìå _When we use Git via the command line, we preface each command with `git`, so that the computer knows we are trying to get Git to do something, rather than some other program._

We‚Äôll do a couple more shell commands now to see what has happened

```
$ ls 			
```
Our folder still shows as empty. If we add the `-a` flag to the `ls` command it will include hidden files, which the .git folder is.
```
$ ls ‚Äìa
  .	..	.git
```
Now the response includes the .git folder is. That is where all of the revision history for this repository will live)

Now that our folder is a Git project we can check its current status (we‚Äôll be doing this a lot).
```
$ git status
  On branch main
  Initial commit
  Nothing to commit
```
If yours shows branch `master` enter the following command to switch it to `main`. This will be important later.
```
git checkout -b main
```

#### üí° Key Points:

‚úÖ Use `git config` with the `--global` flag to configure user name, email address, editor once per machine

‚úÖ `git init` initializes a repository

‚úÖ Git stores all of its repository data in the `.git` directory
