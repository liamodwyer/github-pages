# Using Jekyll Themes and Templates

In the last example we build up the site pretty much from scratch, using a very stripped-back Minima theme. There are lots of other jekyll-based themes and templates that can make the process of building your site a lot quicker. In fact, often it is more a case of stripping out what you don't need from these templates. Knowledge of the Jekyll structure covered in section three above is useful in this process, knowing where to change the relevant content.

In this section we will work through a few examples of this and create a few Github Pages sites in the process.

## Forking and Templates

Forking and Templates are *sort of* similar for the purposes we are using them here i.e. they both enable us to make a copy of an existing theme to use as a jumping off point for a website. However it should be noted that they are different concepts:
 
- Templates are repositories specifically intended to be used a as a boilerplate to copy and build off - for example, for a website. Not all repositories are templates.
- Forking is possible with *all* public repositories on Github. While your copy is independent of the source repository, it keeps a link to it. This is because forking is often done for collaborative work where the person forking may want to contribute back to the source project. 
- When forking, you should check the licence statement of the source repository to correctly credit it

## Creating a repository from a template

Creating a repository from a template

- Navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Above the file list, click `Use this template`
- Select `Create a new repository`

## Forking a repository

- Navigate to the main page of the repository
- Click on the "Fork" button

- By default, forks are named the same as the source repositories. You can change the name to distinguish it further.
- 
- A forked copy will then be added to your own personal list of repositories on GitHub. The small text below the repository name confirms this is a fork.
- 

In both cases you are free to experiment with the repository you have copied, without affecting the original project.
