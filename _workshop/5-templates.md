# Using Jekyll Themes and Templates

In the last example we build up the site pretty much from scratch, using a very stripped-back Minima theme. There are lots of other jekyll-based themes and templates that can make the process of building your site a lot quicker. In fact, often it is more a case of stripping out what you don't need from these templates. Knowledge of the Jekyll structure covered in section three above is useful in this process, knowing where to change the relevant content.

In this section we will work through a few examples of this and create a few Github Pages sites in the process.
