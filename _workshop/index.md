## Introduction

This is the lesson site for DCU Library's workshop on *creating a scholarly website with github pages*. Acadmemic staff and researchers often need to create a website or somewehere to publish material online for different reasons:
- research project website
- open educational resource (OER)
- academic profile or CV
- a scholarly blog

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers an accessible and free solution to creating a simple website to highlight and share your academic work. 

We'll see that using Github Pages for this is a bit different from content management systems like Wordpress, not least in that you will be working with text files withour a user interface. We'll mostly be using a format called *Markdown* for that which is a lightweight and accessible markup language. With just a little practice, you can quickly learn enough to create a site from scratch or *fork* (copy) an existing site template for you to customise and maintain. 

As well as Markdown, you will learn how GitHub Pages integrates with the popular static website generator *Jekyll* to turn your Markdown into a fully functioning website.

You will learn how to set up a project repository, write content in Markdown, and publish your site, all using GitHubâ€™s user friendly web interface. 

> *All of the technical part weâ€™re going to do in the Github interface in the browser. So you donâ€™t need a text editor or to install anything at all.*

## Workshop Setup

To work along with the exercises for this workshop, you can **create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)** if you don't have one already.
Once you create your account, you may be asked to verify your email before you can create content.

So, with your GitHub account in hand, you are all ready! 

*We won't be diving too much into Github's version control functionalities here as we are just using it to host a website but for quick introduction to that side of things check out GitHub's [Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)*
